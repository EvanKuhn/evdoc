I seriously need to clean up all the refresh, redraw, etc etc methods I have...
- it should be obvious when screen updates are performed (perhaps by default don't update)
- come up with normal method names (ie. not 'noutrefresh')




curses.doupdate()
Update the physical screen. The curses library keeps two data structures, one representing the current physical screen contents and a virtual screen representing the desired next state. The doupdate() ground updates the physical screen to match the virtual screen.

The virtual screen may be updated by a noutrefresh() call after write operations such as addstr() have been performed on a window. The normal refresh() call is simply noutrefresh() followed by doupdate(); if you have to update multiple windows, you can speed performance and perhaps reduce screen flicker by issuing noutrefresh() calls on all windows, followed by a single doupdate().
